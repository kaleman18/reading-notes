## Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

    To store data in a web browser even after the user closes the browser or restarts the computer.

## What information should not be stored in local storage?

    Sensitive Information like passwords, credit cards, and personal details.

## Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

    Local storage can only store strings and I would convert it using the toString() method.
