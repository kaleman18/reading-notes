## How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

Hello friend, let me explain what a object is in javascript. An object is a collection of related info.

## What are some advantages to creating object literals?

An advantage is sending data is much more efficient using object literals than sending several individual items.

## How do objects differ from arrays?

objects store properties and arrays only store elements.

## Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

when an objects property name is held in a value.

## Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

"this" refers to the current object the code is being written in.

## What is the DOM?

Document object model. DOM breaks down the content of html into a tree structure.

## Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

JS interacts with dom by accessing the document and is elements. Without DOM, JS wouldn't be able to access html.
