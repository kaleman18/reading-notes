# Readings: React and Forms

## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

its internal state is the state you provided from React. 

## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

When they submit, that way no errors occur.

## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

By using htmlFor attribute

## Why would we use a ternary operator?

To shorten an if statement.

## Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
