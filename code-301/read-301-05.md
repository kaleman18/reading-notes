# Readings: Putting it all together

## What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

A component should only do one thing, if it does more than make a different component.

## What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

Build the app so that it renders everything you need but doesn't have any interactivity. Then add the interactivity after the static render is complete.

## Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

Interactivity!

## What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

Does the data change?
Is it interactive?
Does it change somthing in the allication?


## How can you identify where state needs to live?

Can be in the parent or above the parent and just passed down multiple times.

## What is a “higher-order function”?

Functions that operate in other functions, by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

## Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

it's returnning m that is a function that takes in m and checks if it is greater than n.

## Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

Sometimes reduce and map need to be used twice using higher-order.
