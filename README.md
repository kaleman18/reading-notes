# My Learning Journal

Hello! 

My name is Kyle Aleman and this is my beginning to becoming a Software Developer! And it all starts with **Growth Minset**. 

Growth mindset is never letting unwanted intrusive thoughts take over you mind. Never say this is too hard or am I good enough. Always keep it positive and **_believe in yourself_**.:grin:

### Things to Remind yourself.
- The only guarantee for failure is to stop trying.
- It always seems impossible until it is done.
- Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.
