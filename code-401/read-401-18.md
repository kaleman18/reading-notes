## How can you use regular expressions in Python to search for specific patterns in a string, and what is the primary module to work with them?

The primary module for working with regular expressions is the re module. It provides a set of functions that allow you to search for specific patterns in strings and perform various operations based on those patterns.

## What is the purpose of the shutil module in Python, and provide an example of a common use case for file or directory management with this module?

It provides a higher-level interface for file operations and directory management compared to the basic file I/O functions. It offers a set of functions that allow you to perform common file and directory operations more conveniently.

shutil.copy(source_file, destination_directory)

## Compare and contrast the os and shutil modules. When would you choose to use one over the other?

If you need to perform basic file and directory operations and want a lower-level, more direct interface to the operating system, then os is suitable.

If you are dealing with higher-level file and directory operations, such as copying entire directory trees, moving files across directories, etc., shutil provides more convenient functions.
