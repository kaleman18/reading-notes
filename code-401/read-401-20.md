# Readings: Django Models

## Explain the purpose and basic structure of Django models. How do they help in creating and managing database schema in a Django application?

Django models serve as the representation of database tables, defining the structure and behavior of data within a Django application. By using models, developers can easily create, retrieve, update, and delete records in the database, abstracting away the complexity of SQL queries and facilitating seamless management of the application's database schema.

## Describe the primary features and functionality of the Django Admin interface. How can it be customized to suit the specific needs of a project?

The Django Admin interface provides a pre-built, customizable interface for managing application data, allowing administrators to perform CRUD operations on database records without writing custom views. It can be customized by modifying admin.py files, leveraging ModelAdmin classes, and utilizing various options such as fieldsets, list_display, list_filter, and search_fields to tailor the interface according to the project's requirements.

## Briefly outline the key components and workflow of a Django application, as discussed in the Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Django. How do these components interact with each other to create a functional web application?

In a Django application, the key components include models, views, templates, and URLs. Models define the data structure, views handle the business logic, templates display the user interface, and URLs map incoming requests to the appropriate views, all working together within the MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture to create a functional web application.
