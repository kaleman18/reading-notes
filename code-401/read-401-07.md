## Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.

Scope is what parts of code have access to what. Local scope is what is available within the defined parts of code. Global scope is accessable to all parts of the code.

## How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?

- global() returns a dictionary containing the names of all of the global functions.
- locals() returns a dictionary containing the names of all the local functions.

Global can be used to share data across functions in larger programs.

## In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis.

It classifys algorithms depending on how their run time or space requirements vary as the input size varies.

## Based on the Rolling Dice Example, explain how you would simulate a dice roll using Python. Describe how you would use code to calculate the probability of rolling a specific number (e.g., the probability of rolling a 6) over a large number of trials.

I would count the number of times each side of the dice gets rolled on. Then use a large number of trials for accuracy.
