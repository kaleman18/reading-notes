## What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher, and how was it used historically?

The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique that involves shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. Historically, Caesar is said to have used a shift of 3 to protect his military messages. However, the Caesar Cipher is a very simple and easily breakable encryption method, especially with modern computational power. 

## What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?

- Symmetric Encryption: In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. The communicating parties need to share this secret key in advance.
- Asymmetric Encryption: Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key can be freely distributed, while the private key must be kept secret.

In secure communication today, asymmetric encryption plays a crucial role in addressing key distribution challenges associated with symmetric encryption.

## How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cryptography.

Computers typically generate random numbers using algorithms. However, it's important to note that these algorithms are deterministic, meaning that if you know the initial conditions (seed), you can predict the entire sequence of numbers generated. Therefore, these numbers are often referred to as "pseudo-random numbers."
PRNGs are suitable for many applications, TRNGs are preferred in scenarios where a high degree of unpredictability and entropy is crucial, such as in cryptographic key generation for secure communication and data protection.

## Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.

- Encryption: Encryption is the process of converting plaintext or readable data into a different form (ciphertext) using an algorithm and a key.

- Decryption: Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. It involves converting the ciphertext back into its original plaintext form, using the appropriate decryption algorithm and the key.

- In this analogy:
    Plaintext (Original Letter): This is your message in its readable form.
    Ciphertext (Locked Box): This is the encrypted message, which is not easily understandable without the key.
    Encryption Key (Key to the Lock): The key is used to perform the encryption, turning the plaintext into ciphertext.
    Decryption Key (Key to Unlock): The key is needed to reverse the process, turning the ciphertext back into the original plaintext.
