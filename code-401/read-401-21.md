# Readings: Django CRUD and Forms

## How do Django Forms facilitate user input handling, and what are some key components of creating a form using the Django framework?

Django Forms streamline user input handling by providing an abstraction layer that simplifies form creation, validation, and data processing within Django applications. Key components of creating a form using Django include defining a form class inheriting from forms.Form or forms.ModelForm, specifying fields with their respective types and validation rules, and rendering the form in templates using Django's template language along with form tags and CSRF.

## Explain the purpose of Django Templates in web development and describe how template inheritance can be utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability.

Django Templates serve the purpose of separating the presentation layer from the business logic in web development, allowing developers to create dynamic web pages easily. Template inheritance in Django enables code reusability and maintainability by providing a way to define a base template containing common elements and then extending or overriding specific sections in child templates. This approach promotes cleaner code organization, reduces redundancy, and simplifies updates across multiple pages by centralizing common layout elements in a single location.

## Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.

Django Views play a crucial role in handling HTTP requests by processing incoming requests from the client, executing business logic, and returning an appropriate HTTP response. Function-based views (FBVs) are defined as Python functions that take an HTTP request as input and return an HTTP response, providing simplicity and flexibility but requiring developers to handle all aspects of request processing manually. On the other hand, class-based views (CBVs) are Django's object-oriented approach to views, where views are defined as classes inheriting from Django's built-in view classes, offering built-in methods for common HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) and providing features like mixins, decorators, and inheritance for code reuse and organization, which can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code compared to FBVs.
