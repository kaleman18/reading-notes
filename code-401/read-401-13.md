# Readings: Linear Regressions

## Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?

A method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

Linear regression purpose in machine learning and data analysis is to make predictions, understand relationsips, and model interpretability. 

## Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

- Import the library.

- Load and prepare.

- Create and train the model.

- Make predictions.

- Evaluate model performance.

## What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?

Splitting the dataset into train and test sets allows for evaluation of a MLM performance. It ultiminately assesses the model's ability to generalize the new data. It contributes to the evaluation of machine learning model's performance by adding accuracy and precision.
