## How does the White Noise library contribute to the efficient serving of static files in a Django application, and what are the steps to integrate it into a project?

The White Noise library enhances static file serving by serving them directly from the application's assets directory, reducing the load on the web server. To integrate it, install the library, configure Django to use it as middleware, and ensure proper static files setup in settings.py.
