# Readings: FileIO & Exceptions

## What is the purpose of the ‘with’ statement when opening a file in Python, and how does it help manage resources while reading and writing files?

It ensures that the file closes right after processing them to ensure the file doesn't stay open and use up too many resources.

## Explain the difference between the ‘read()’ and ‘readline()’ methods for file objects in Python. Provide examples of when to use each method.

read() is used to read the entire file or a number of bytes and the readline() is used to read the contents of one line in a file or the number of characters if an argument is passed.

## Briefly describe the concept of exception handling in Python. How can the ‘try’, ‘except’, and ‘finally’ blocks be used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code? Provide a simple example.

- try = always run the code in the try block first until an exception is thrown.
- except = runs this code when there is an exception.
- finally = always run this code last.
