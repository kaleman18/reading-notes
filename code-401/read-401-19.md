# Readings: Intro to Django

## What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application?

Django is a Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

- Model: Models in Django are Python classes that represent the structure of the data and define the schema of the database. Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) maps these model classes to database tables, allowing developers to interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL. Models handle tasks such as data validation, querying the database, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- View: Views in Django are Python functions or classes responsible for processing user requests and returning responses.

- Template: Templates in Django are HTML files with embedded Python code, which allows for dynamic generation of content. Templates are responsible for presenting the data to users in a user-friendly format.

- URL Dispatcher: The URL dispatcher in Django maps URLs to views, allowing for clean and flexible URL patterns. It routes incoming requests to the appropriate view based on the URL patterns defined in the URL configuration.

- Admin Interface: Django provides an automatically generated admin interface for managing application data. The admin interface allows authorized users to perform CRUD operations on database records without writing custom views or templates.

- Middleware: Middleware in Django is a framework of hooks into Django's request/response processing. It's a lightweight, low-level plugin system that allows developers to modify or enhance the request/response cycle globally or for specific views.

## Explain the role of Djangoâ€™s MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle.

- Model: Represents the data structure and manages interactions with the database.
- View: Handles user interactions, processes requests, and communicates with the model and template.
- Template: Defines the presentation layer, allowing the dynamic generation of HTML.

The user sends a request to the Django application.
The URL patterns direct the request to the corresponding view.
The view interacts with the model to fetch or manipulate data.
The template renders the dynamic HTML, incorporating data from the view.
The response is sent back to the user.

## What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that emphasizes customization and flexibility, while Bootstrap CSS follows a component-based approach with pre-designed components and a more opinionated design philosophy.
