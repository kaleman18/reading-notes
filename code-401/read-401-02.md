# Readings: Testing and Modules

## What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?

The key principles of TDD are to start writing the test first and make sure they are failing. Next write the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test to ensure functionality. After the test passes then we refactor the test.

## Explain the purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts. What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?

The purpose of this statement is to check if the python file is being run as the main program.

## Describe the concept of recursion in Python.

Recursion is a method of solving problems where a function calls itself. This brakes down complex problems into smaller problems.

## What is the difference between Python modules and packages? Explain how to create, import, and use them in your Python programs.

- Python Modules is a file with vaiables, functions, or classes. They can be exported and imported using dot notation.

- Python Packages is a directory with an init.py file containing modules.
