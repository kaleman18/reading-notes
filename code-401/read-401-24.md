# Readings: Permissions & Postgresql

## What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?

Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions provide a way to control access to resources in an API. They enforce rules on who can view, edit, or delete data based on user authentication and authorization levels, thereby enhancing API security.

## In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

The SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from a database. To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees', you would write: SELECT * FROM employees;

## Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?

DRF Generic Views offer pre-built views for common CRUD operations in RESTful APIs, reducing code duplication and simplifying development. For instance, using ListCreateAPIView, you can handle GET (list) and POST (create) requests for a resource like 'employees' in a single view class.
