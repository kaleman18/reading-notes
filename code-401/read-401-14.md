# Readings: Data Visualization

## What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

Relational Plots:

    Creates a scatter plot with a linear fit.
    Example: Use lmplot.

Categorical Plots:

    Shows point estimates and confidence intervals with bars.
    Example: Use barplot.

Distribution Plots

    Plots univariate distribution (histogram or kernel density).
    Example: sns.distplot.

## In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

Relplot() is used to compare two variables.
catplot() shows data catagores.
distplot() visualizes data spread like exam score distribution.

## Discuss the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developerâ€™s workflow. What are some key sections or elements featured in the cheat sheet that can help a developer quickly reference Seaborn functionalities?

It can be a quick reference, a learning tool, or something to increase efficiency for any developer. The syntax examples can be copied and pasted for quick work. It also summarized functions that are available for different type of data visualization.
