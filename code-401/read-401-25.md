# Readings: Authentication & Production Server

## What is the primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how do they work in terms of encoding and decoding data?

    JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) primarily serve the purpose of securely transmitting information between parties as a compact, URL-safe string, commonly used for authentication and authorization. They work by encoding data into a JSON object which is then signed or encrypted, enabling stateless authentication and authorization mechanisms through the use of digitally signed tokens.

## How does JWT Authentication integrate with Django REST Framework to secure API endpoints, and what are the key components involved in this process?

    JWT Authentication integrates with Django REST Framework by utilizing authentication classes provided by the framework to validate JWT tokens and authenticate users, typically involving serializers for token parsing and validation, views for endpoint access control, and authentication backends for user authentication based on the JWT tokens.

## Why is Djangoâ€™s built-in runserver not suitable for production environments, and what are some alternative server options that should be considered for deploying a Django application?

    Django's built-in runserver is not suitable for production environments due to its lack of scalability, limited security features, and poor performance under heavy loads. Alternative server options such as Gunicorn, uWSGI, or deploying with ASGI servers like Daphne or uvicorn should be considered for deploying a Django application in production.
